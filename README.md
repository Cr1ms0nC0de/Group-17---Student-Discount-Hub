# Group-17-Student-Discount-Hub
The Student Discount Hub provides a centralized, student-driven, web-based platform for discovering, sharing, and organizing discounts.

The system is a web application hosted here with an Airtable backend. It is designed as a lightweight, client-side solution where JavaScript in the browser fetches and displays discount data from Airtableâ€™s API.

As a regular user you will be able to view, search, and filter discounts.
If you become a contributor you will be able to also submit, edit, and report discounts.
